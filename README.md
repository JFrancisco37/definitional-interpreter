# definitional-interpreter
An OCaml implementation of a definitional interpreter for the L2 language, a small imperative language with references, conditionals, loops, I/O, and static type checking. The interpreter follows a small-step operational semantics and includes a type system. Optional extensions like arrays, exceptions, or for loops may also be supported.
